1
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:14,348
More.

2
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:24,399
Another.

3
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:27,986
Careful, señor.

4
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:30,531
Hot day like today...

5
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,866
...too much oil in the machine...

6
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,577
...can cause it to blow a gasket.

7
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:40,624
There are two kinds of men
in this world.

8
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,459
Those who drink...

9
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,545
...and those who pour.

10
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,714
Shut up and fill my glass.

11
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:00,143
Hey, you two.

12
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:01,770
Yes, you.

13
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,523
I used to be just like you.

14
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:08,068
Worked dirt for the man
till my hands bled.

15
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:09,945
But no more.

16
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:14,575
Because I learned that a man
can never drink his fill...

17
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,827
...by waiting in line for the tap.

18
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:18,579
Listen to him.

19
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21

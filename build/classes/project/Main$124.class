1
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,160
Why?

2
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:39,623
Why is this still under discussion?

3
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,879
I don't like him.

4
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:48,549
I don't care who he knows.

5
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:53,303
We're supposed to trust
him with our products.

6
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:57,266
Big man.

7
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,101
Big Generalissimo!

8
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,229
Big fry cook is more like it.

9
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:04,940
The". Chicken Man."

10
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,192
You will do what you want.

11
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,528
But you have my vote.

12
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:19,663
Never trust a South American.

13
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,332
Dirty, dirty people.

14
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:30,549
He broke my toy! He broke my toy!

15
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,844
He was just having fun.

16
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:37,014
You'll get over it.

17
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:40,142
No! I hate him! I wish he was dead!

18
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:55,949
Marco.
